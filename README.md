## Introduction

This notebook walks through the process of loading a dataset, cleaning and transforming the data, exploring trends, and conducting basic statistical analyses. The notebook serves as a foundational guide for performing common data analysis tasks.

## Setup and Dependencies

To run this notebook, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
- `seaborn` (for advanced plotting)
- `scipy` (for statistical analysis)

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this notebook is a [brief description of your dataset here], containing information such as:

- **Column 1:** Description
- **Column 2:** Description
- **Column 3:** Description

You can load the dataset by running the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')
```

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, we perform the following steps:

- Handling missing values
- Dropping unnecessary columns
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (if necessary)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section visualizes key patterns and insights in the data using various charts, including:

- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Box plots

## Statistical Analysis

We perform basic statistical tests and analysis such as:

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
- Hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests)
- Regression analysis

## Conclusion

Summarize the insights gained from the analysis and potential next steps.
